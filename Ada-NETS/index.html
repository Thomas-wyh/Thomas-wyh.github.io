        <p>
          Face clustering has attracted rising research interest recently to take advantage of massive amounts of face images on the web.
          State-of-the-art performance has been achieved by Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) due to their powerful representation capacity.
          However, existing GCN-based methods build face graphs mainly according to $k$NN relations in the feature space, which may lead to a lot of noise edges connecting two faces of different classes.
          The face features will be polluted when messages pass along these noise edges, thus degrading the performance of GCNs.
          In this paper, a novel algorithm named Ada-NETS is proposed to cluster faces by constructing clean graphs for GCNs.
          In Ada-NETS, each face is transformed to a new structure space, obtaining robust features by considering face features of the neighbour images. Then, an adaptive neighbour discovery strategy is proposed to determine a proper number of edges connecting to each face image. It significantly reduces the noise edges while maintaining the good ones to build a graph with clean yet rich edges for GCNs to cluster faces.
          Experiments on multiple public clustering datasets show that Ada-NETS significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, proving its superiority and generalization.

          <strong>The framework of Ada-NETS.</strong>
          (i) The features are transformed to the structure space to obtain better similarity metrics.
          (ii) The neighbours of each vertex are discovered by an adaptive filter.
          (iii) A graph is built with the neighbour relations discovered by (ii) and the graph is used by the GCN model to classify vertex pairs. The final clustering results are obtained using embeddings from GCNs to link vertex pairs with high similarities.
